# Fluent Bundle

The `fluent-rs` workspace is a collection of Rust crates implementing [Project Fluent][],
a localization system designed to unleash the entire expressive power of natural language translations.

This crate exposes a low level implementation of a collection of localization messages for a single locale.

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/projectfluent/fluent-rs/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/projectfluent/fluent-rs?branch=main)

Project Fluent keeps simple things simple and makes complex things possible.
The syntax used for describing translations is easy to read and understand.  At
the same time it allows, when necessary, to represent complex concepts from
natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and others.

Usage
-----

```rust
use fluent_bundle::{FluentBundle, FluentResource};
use unic_langid::langid;

fn main() {
    let ftl_string = "hello-world = Hello, world!".to_owned();
    let res = FluentResource::try_new(ftl_string)
        .expect("Could not parse an FTL string.");

    let langid_en = langid!("en");
    let mut bundle = FluentBundle::new(vec![langid_en]);

    bundle.add_resource(&res)
        .expect("Failed to add FTL resources to the bundle.");

    let msg = bundle.get_message("hello-world")
        .expect("Failed to retrieve a message.");
    let val = msg.value.expect("Message has no value.");

    let mut errors = vec![];
    let value = bundle.format_pattern(val, None, &mut errors);

    assert_eq!(&value, "Hello, world!");
}
```


Learn the FTL syntax
--------------------

FTL is a localization file format used for describing translation resources.
FTL stands for _Fluent Translation List_.

FTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent
complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations, and
others.

    hello-user = Hello, { $username }!

[Read the Fluent Syntax Guide][] in order to learn more about the syntax.  If
you're a tool author you may be interested in the formal [EBNF grammar][].
